# onlineOrder project: A spring and Hibernate based online food ordering system.

#Implemented Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, searching food, ordering, checkout etc.

#Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage from RDS instance(menu, restaurants etc.).

#Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.

#Used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application.

#Build the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users add items to the shopping cart and place orders.	

#Deployed the application to AWS EC2 for better availability.
